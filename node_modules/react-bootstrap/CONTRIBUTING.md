# Contributing

We welcome community support with both pull requests and reporting bugs. Please
don't hesitate to jump in.

## Current Issues

[![HuBoard][huboard-badge]][huboard]

We use HuBoard to triage issues and prioritize the backlog for the core dev
team. Feel free to tackle any currently open [issue][issues]. The issues tagged
with "help wanted" and especially those high in the backlog are fair game.

## Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

## Code Style

Please adhere to the current code styling. We have included an `.editorconfig`
at the repo's root to facilitate uniformity regardless of your editor. See the
[editor config site][editorconfig] for integration details.

We use [ESLint][eslint] for all JavaScript Linting. There should be no linting
errors and no new warnings for new work. You are welcome to configure your
editor to use ESLint or the `npm test` command will run unit tests and the
linter.

## Commit Subjects for Public API Changes

If your patch **changes the API or fixes a bug** please use one of the following
prefixes in your commit subject:

- `[fixed] ...`
- `[changed] ...`
- `[added] ...`
- `[removed] ...`

That ensures the subject line of your commit makes it into the auto-generated
changelog. Do not use these tags if your change doesn't fix a bug and doesn't
change the public API.

### When using `[changed]` or `[removed]`...

Please include an upgrade path with example code in the commit message.  If it
doesn't make sense to do this, then it doesn't make sense to use `[changed]` or
`[removed]` :). For further reading on writing a well formed commit message,
check out these [5 useful tips for a better commit message][commit-message]

## Docs

Please update the docs with any API changes, the code and docs should always be
in sync.

## Implement additional components and features

This project is seeking parity with the core Bootstrap library.
Component by component to the extent it is possible.

Also Bootstrap mentions http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples
as examples of things you can do, but they are not part of the core library,
therefore this project is the wrong place to implement them.
